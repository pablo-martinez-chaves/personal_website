  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        I am a student pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering. I´m interested in
        software development and technology, and I am currently acquiring
        basic knowledge in programming, systems, and web development. 
       
    </p>

    <p>
        Beyond technology, I have been playing the piano for almost six years, an experience that has taught me discipline, patience, and musical sensitivity. More recently, I have started learning to play the Spanish guitar, which has allowed me to explore new styles and enrich my musical knowledge. Music, much like programming, requires constant practice, attention to detail, and passion, and I greatly enjoy the balance I find between both worlds.
    </p>

    <p>
        Another major passion of mine is video games. Since I was young, they have fascinated me because they combine strategy, creativity, and storytelling, while also offering the chance to experience worlds and challenges beyond everyday life. Video games have helped me develop logical thinking and problem-solving skills, while also providing a space for fun and relaxation.
    </p>

    <p>
        Football, however, is where my heart truly lies. I have had a ball at my feet for as long as I can remember. I started my journey in the sport with Atlético de Madrid, but due to the long commute to training sessions, I moved to a closer club, Rayo Majadahonda, where I have been playing for the past 12 years. Football has taught me teamwork, perseverance, and resilience, and being on the field is a constant source of joy and personal growth for me.
