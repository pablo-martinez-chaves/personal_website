    <h2>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
    <p>
      Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that on
      creating systems capable of performing tasks that normally require human intelligence. 
      This includes problem-solving, learning, understanding language, and recognizing patterns.
    </p>
    <p>
      AI can be classified into different types, such as narrow AI, which is designed for HEAD
      specific tasks, and general AI, which aims to perform any intellectual task a human can do.
      specific tasks, and general AI, which objective is to perform any intellectual task a human can do.
